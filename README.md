# Renderdude: Raytracer
A raytracer done in a weekend (and as many as you can think of)

-Dependencies of Renderdude: Raytracer

* GCC: Most recent is best. **Utilizes OpenMP.**
* GLM: 0.9.8.5 nicest.
* Nothings' stb_image_write is used.

-How to Compile Renderdude: Raytracer

Run build.bat.

-Features

* Lightning (y'all wanted it)
* Reflections (comes with free artifacting)
* Even more spheres (sphere)
* Planes (popular request by many spheres for a friend that isn't a sphere)
* Materials (choose between not so shiny, shiny and reflect thing!)
* Colored Lightning (it's like lightning with colors other than greyscale)
* Checkers (Checkers)
* Camera Rotation (Get them sick angles)
* Big resolutions (full hd!)
* Multisampling Anti-Aliasing (no longer the (too) sharpest tool in the shed.)

# Does it run fast?
I put in a small timer with chrono so you can see how much time it takes to run things. OpenMP also helps.

# What is the state of this thing?
A HD 4 samples image takes around 38-40 seconds to render. Honestly, this project was made more to have something interesting to do while I was bored. However, now that I am working on a few things I like more, Renderdude only gets worked on whenever I also feel bored. There are not a lot of papers/stuff I could find to learn more about raytracing, and any I find usually are either stuff I already did or stuff I have difficulty reading on due to me being more attracted towards "show, don't tell". 

Unfortunately in Real Life, a 15 year old cannot write a raytracer the level of something like a 90's one or better without dedicating entire days of which a third I spend in school monday through friday. Could I do it? Sure, maybe. But with a lack of higher knowledge about some things, and the fact no one really wants to teach me about those concepts (they have better things to do), honestly, this is better off dead.
